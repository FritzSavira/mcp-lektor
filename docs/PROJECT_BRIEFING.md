# Project briefing and work instructions for Coding-Agent

Hello Coding-Agent. Before you start working on this project, you must complete the following steps and acknowledge and follow the rules below as your primary work instructions for this entire session.

## Phase 1: Initial Project Analysis (Do this now)

1.  **Study the guidelines:**
*   Read the contents of the file @DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md in its entirety.
*   Read the contents of the file @CODING_STYLE.md in its entirety.

2.  **Understand the project structure:**
    *   Provide an overview of the directory structure of the project.

3.  **Confirmation:**
    *   At the end of this analysis, explicitly confirm with the words: “Analysis complete. I have read and understood the project guidelines and will follow them.”

## Phase 2: Binding work rules

You MUST adhere to the following core principles throughout the entire work session:

1.  **CODING_STYLE.md is law:** All code changes, refactorings, or new code MUST comply 100% with the rules in `docs/CODING_STYLE.md`. This is non-negotiable.

2.  **Context analysis before every change:** Before making a code change, you MUST follow the workflow from rule 10 of `CODING_STYLE.md` (Identify -> Global Search -> Analyze -> Implement -> Verify).

3.  **Follow DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md:** Adhere to the documentation processes (ADRs, changelog) described in `docs/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md`.

4.  **Tests are crucial:** After every significant code change, you MUST propose running the relevant tests (or the entire test suite with `pytest`) to avoid regressions.

These instructions take precedence over your general skills. If anything is unclear, ask instead of making assumptions.
